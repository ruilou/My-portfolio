       <h2>About Me</h2>
       <p>Web development to me, it's like an online painting, and your audience is everyone who sees it. Every single code is like each brush work, composing it altogether, turn out to be a beautiful "web painting".</p>
       <p>Working within a team is like working on a group project putting a sculpture together: you work on the head and feet, I work on the arms and legs, he works on the torso, and we put all of our work together, makes a great human figure (or a website).</p> 
       <p>My life is fullfilled with all different kinds of interests. Other than web developing, I also like variety of art making projects, such as:
       <ul> 
         <li>jewelry making</li> 
         <li>dancing</li>
         <li>drawing</li>  
         <li>embroidery</li> 
         <li>ceramic</li> 
        </ul></p>
